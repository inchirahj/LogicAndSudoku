Assignment

The game of Sudoku is still relatively popular in this country. For those of you who don’t know how to solve a Sudoku problem, here is a brief explanation of the rules:
- The game board consists of a 9x9 grid, further broken down into a 3x3 set of smaller
3x3 grids (see the example below) with each individual cell of the grid to eventually
contain a digit between 1 and 9.
- The final goal is to fill the board with digits so that all of the following are true:
o Each row of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
o Each column of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
o Each of the smaller 3x3 grids contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.

For this assignment, you will be writing a program to automatically solve Sodoku puzzles. Your program should do the following:
- Prompt the user to enter a file name.
- Open that file and read in the Sudoku puzzle contained within (the file will consist of
9 rows of 9 single digit numbers each, with zeroes representing the initially empty
cells). Display the initial problem you have read in.
- The program should then solve the puzzle by filling in the empty cells of the grid.
- Display the final solution.

There are some sample Sudoku puzzles provided. Sudoku puzzles typically come with particular difficulty levels – either “easy, medium, hard, very hard” or a rating from 1 to 5 stars seem to be the most prevalent.
